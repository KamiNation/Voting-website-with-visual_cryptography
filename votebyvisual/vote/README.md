## Please README first

This is a project that aims to prevent phishing attacks on a voting platform using visual cryptography. The website was not developed by me from scratch but was made available for use by the original developer.

I was able to get a visual cryptography scheme code to use with the website and figure out the code in Python to merge the created share.

## Issues

1. The project is developed in Django Python and I have it working to the point where for each user registration a share is created but I can seem to create a file upload on the website.

2. I also do not have the website sending a share to the user working but I have the code in it already.

So developers are welcome to give it a try.
